This project involves developing a text-based simulation in which a mouse navigates a maze to collect food.  The mouse is depicted by the @ character, the cheese by % characters, and the otherwise empty vs wall-occupied locations in the room are depicted by . and # characters respectively. 



Here’s an example trace:
