# CS 300: PROGRAMMING II

Exercises and projects from CS 300 course at University of Wisconsin - Madison.

We’ll be writing and organizing Java code in an Object-Oriented (OO) style.  We’ll be implementing several common Abstract Data Types (ADTs) using a variety of data structures.  And we’ll compare different implementations using asymptotic complexity analyses.  The concept of “abstraction” will be central to many of our discussions.
