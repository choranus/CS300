In this project, we will implement a priority queue using a heap to simulate an airplane boarding system.



Sample input and output:

```
Boarding start time: 1
 
Passengers:
Gary, 0, 2A
Alexi, 2, 3A
Mouna, 2, 1A
```

```
1 Boarding begins
 
1 Gary 2A (done 6)
2 Mouna 1A (done 7)
3 Alexi 3A (done 12)
13 All passengers have boarded!
```
