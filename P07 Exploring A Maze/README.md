In this project, we will implement an algorithm for finding a path through a maze. We will use a stack to store path information as the algorithm proceeds.



Here is an example:

```
Solution is:
+---+---+---+
| S   * | F | 
+---+   +   + 
|     *   * | 
+---+---+---+
Path is: [0,0] --> [0,1] --> [1,1] --> [1,2] --> [0,2]
```
